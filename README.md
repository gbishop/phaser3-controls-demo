-----------
This is just a demo project used for learning purpose. All assets are non commercial I get from the tutorial page. The project directory I used are from https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template.

**I include some extra commenting and extra feature not included in the tutorial page.**

I don't include the node module required to run the game, so to prepare the project follow the "how-to" in the https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template. You need to use the node command npm install, npm start, npm run build.
